In this blog, we see how to build openssl static on mac
* The steps 
- Downlod the source
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl
#+END_SRC

- Check to the branch you what
At here, we assuse it's =OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable=
#+BEGIN_SRC 
git checkout OpenSSl_1_1_1-stable
#+END_SRC

- download perl
  
- use perl to config the build env
We assuse the output dirctory is D:\source\openssl\build
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
perl Configure VC-WIN32 no-shared --prefix=D:\source\openssl\build
#+END_SRC

- build
#+BEGIN_SRC 
nmake
#+END_SRC
This will build =libcrypto.lib= and =libssl.lib= in the D:\source\openssl directory, it seem like that =--prefix= doesn't work, we don't care.

* Use
You can use the libcrypto.lib in your project, notice that it's dependents on crypt32.lib, which you must add =#pragma comment(lib, "crypt32.lib")= at your source file.
