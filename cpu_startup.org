- startup, set pc to
  | x86    | 0xffff0(16 bit) 0xfffffff0(32 or 64 bit) |
  | arm    |                               0x00000000 |
  | mips   |                               0xbfc00000 |
  | risc-v |                               0x80000000 |
  - x86 16bit can see 0xffff0, because can use segment register
below, I use x86 16 bit as example

- bios
because the main board link in the cpu pin, so main board can manager the address, almost most case the 0xffff0 is the rom address. And it
contains the biso program

- load floppy
  use floopy as example, bios load the first section of flooy to mem 0x7c00 and jump to this address
  load floppy is complecated. So use ad speration paragraph


* bios load floppy first section to mem
