In vue2, If a computed field type is string, and it's calc by some object, then the object changed, but the calc result is not same(equals).

If I watch this field, will watch trigger?

Read the vue2 source and findout the reason is difficult. So I will just create a test project, and see what's happen.

Witl simple pseudocode

#+begin_src vue
watch: {
  cFiled() {
    console.log('some value' chaned)
  }
},
computed: {
  cFiled() {
    return someObject.someField
  }
}

someObject = {
  foo: 'bar',
  someField: 'origin value'
}
#+end_src

After test, the watch is not called, So it maybe compare cField old and new value.
